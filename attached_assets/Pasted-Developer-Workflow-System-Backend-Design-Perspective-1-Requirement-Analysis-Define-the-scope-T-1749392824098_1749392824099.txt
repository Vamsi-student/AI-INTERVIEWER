Developer Workflow (System/Backend Design Perspective)
1. Requirement Analysis
Define the scope: Types of interviews (MCQ, subjective, viva).

Identify user personas: Candidate, Admin/Recruiter.

Include accessibility needs (e.g., for PWD users).

2. Tech Stack Selection
Frontend: React.js (for dynamic UI)

Backend: Flask / FastAPI / Node.js

Database: PostgreSQL / MongoDB

ML/NLP: HuggingFace Transformers, OpenAI API, spaCy

Speech-to-Text: Google STT / Whisper / Azure

Text-to-Speech: gTTS / Amazon Polly

Hosting: AWS / Azure / Render

Authentication: Firebase Auth / JWT

3. Module Development
üß† AI/NLP Models:
MCQ Scoring: Rule-based + ML validation

Subjective Answers: BERT/RoBERTa + Semantic similarity + Grammar check

Viva Voce:

Convert audio ‚Üí text (ASR)

Use ChatGPT/OpenAI or fine-tuned LLM for question generation & response evaluation

üéôÔ∏è Voice Integration:
Implement Text-to-Speech (for bot questions)

Implement Speech-to-Text (for user responses)

4. APIs & Backend Logic
GET /questions: Fetch interview questions dynamically

POST /answer: Receive and score user responses

POST /voice: Upload audio; transcribe + evaluate

GET /result: View detailed evaluation (score + feedback)

5. Frontend Development
Candidate Dashboard: Start test, answer, upload voice

Admin Panel: Upload questions, view candidate analytics

Viva Screen: Real-time Q&A via voice

Accessibility: Keyboard navigation, screen reader support

6. Testing
Unit tests (Pytest/Jest)

Model accuracy evaluation

Load testing for concurrent interviews

7. Deployment
Containerize using Docker

CI/CD using GitHub Actions

Deploy to cloud (AWS EC2 / Azure App Service)

8. Monitoring & Feedback
Logging: Errors, model confidence scores

Analytics: Time taken, question difficulty

Feedback loop: Improve model with real interview data

üôã User Workflow (Candidate Perspective)
1. Login/Register
Register or log in via OTP/email

Select job role/skill test type

2. Test Instructions
Bot explains format via text or voice (with TTS)

Duration and rules shown

3. Interview Begins
MCQ Round
Bot asks MCQs (timed)

User selects answers

Subjective Round
Bot asks descriptive questions

User types or dictates answers (converted to text)

Viva (Voice) Round
Bot asks voice-based questions

User answers via microphone

Bot gives next question in real-time or after pause

4. Submission
After all rounds, candidate reviews & submits

Audio + text answers saved to DB

5. Feedback & Results
Bot gives score + AI-generated feedback:

Answer relevance

Communication skills

Grammar and confidence

Optionally, show visual analytics (pie chart, radar cha
